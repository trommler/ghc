/* LDV profiling:
 *   After all, we do *NOT* need to call LDV_RECORD_CREATE() for IND
 *   closures because they are inherently used. But, it corrupts
 *   the invariants that every closure keeps its creation time in the profiling
 *  field. So, we call LDV_RECORD_CREATE().
 */

/* Note [Write barrier on thunk updates]
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 *
 * Thunk updates are rather tricky, especially on architectures with weak memory
 * ordering guarantees. updateWithIndirection plays a significant role in the
 * update process, implementing the logic for turning a thunk or blackhole into
 * an indirection.
 *
 * Before replacing a closure with an indirection we must first ensure that the
 * writes that initialize the newly-created indirectee are available to other
 * cores. For this reason, we must place a write barrier between the
 * construction of the indirectee and the write to the indirectee field of the
 * indirection.
 *
 * However note that we do *not* impose an ordering on the writes to the
 * indirection's indirectee and info table pointer fields. It is in principle
 * possible for the writes to p1->info to become visible before those to
 * p1->indirectee. However, this is okay since we know that this field was
 * earlier set to the owning TSO or blocking queue. When the stg_BLACKHOLE entry
 * code sees a blackhole whose indirectee is a TSO or blocking queue it will
 * retry or block as appropriate.
 *
 * See #15449.
 */

/*
 * We have two versions of this macro (sadly), one for use in C-- code,
 * and the other for C.
 *
 * The and_then argument is a performance hack so that we can paste in
 * the continuation code directly.  It helps shave a couple of
 * instructions off the common case in the update code, which is
 * worthwhile (the update code is often part of the inner loop).
